A basic file processor.
It receives a commands file and outputs filtered and sorted
lists of files corresponding to each orders section in this file (See structure below).

This exercise aimed at the application of well-known Object-Oriented Programming principles and concepts in Java.
It demonstrates using Inheritance and Polymorphism while keeping principles like data encapsulation and modularity, as well as the usage of different design patterns.
Another goal is practicing error handling using the exception mechanism of Java*.

The different packages:

fileprocessing -
Main class. Interpreters the commands file, access to the path, manage the other packages,
and outputs the results.

filters -
Filters a files list by different filters supported by the program.

sorting -
Sorts a files list. Implements different sorters.

*Note: Due to educational reasons, there is almost no use of the built-in exceptions of Java
in this exercise. Instead, each package includes its own custom exceptions.

The commands file's structure:

***************************************
* FILTER                              * - Begginning of a section
* <filter_name>#(optional suffix:)NOT * - filter parameters
* ORDER                               * 
* <sorting_order_name>                * - sorter parameters
* FILTER                              * - Begginning of a new section
* <filter_name>                       * - ...
* ORDER                               *
* <sorting_order_name>                *
* ...                                 *
